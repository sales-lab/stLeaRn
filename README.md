R wrapper for stLearn.

[stLearn](https://github.com/BiomedicalMachineLearning/stLearn) by
[Pham et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.31.125658), is
designed to comprehensively analyse Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data
to investigate complex biological processes within an undissociated
tissue.

  - create a wrapper for stLearn in R, using `reticulate` and
    `basilisk`
  - create a short script with an example workflow showing how to use
    the wrapper
